        Plan 
            Make a single csv file containing all the needed shit by piecing together affiliation id and eid /\\
            For the visualization of growth
                from all the data, filter Philippines. 
                Then, count the number of publications per year 
                Create a new csv file containing the graph of the publication growth
            
            Questions:
                Topic of interest? (What percentage of the growth belonged to each topic cumulatively over years)
                    Filter by subject area and department 
                        Filter subject area abbreviation
                        For subject area, record year of publication 
                        group by year and subject area 
                        proportion chart
                    create a new csv file containing the graph of the records and at which proportion
                    Create a histogram thingy, in time and in proportion
                Hosting departments (Which departments host the most amount of productivity)
                    Filter by department
                    Show which department is from which, shit like that
                    Create a commulative pie graph and the pie graph for 2020
        I need to be in a library to do this shit frfr. Should be fun 

        How do we analyze shit from the given data. There are three major questions
            A visualization of the growth of Philippine Publication over time 
            A question you wanna ask that can be answered by the given data 
            Another question you wanna ask that can be answered by the given data 


GR Paper
What is it trying to say?
    Classical methods for deriving GR, specifically gravitational waves, using TT coordinates, are unyieldy and may cause misconceptions upon introduction to the curriculum. 
    Methods, such as the Fermi cooridinate fram, a quasi-cartesian coordinate frame provide a better way of teaching by showing obsevable events in gravitomagnetic space 

    A review of classical methods (they lost me)
    The introduction of the fermi coordinate system and gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic frame to substitute for a pure space time thing, substitute gravity with electromagnetic effects
    Basically relates how the maxwell equations can be used as an analogue to understand gravitational waves, the gravitoelectromagnetic potential, if you will]
    Antennas that detect waves like how LIGO does

Why am I reviewing this?
    Discuss the most essential parts of the paper
    Include some form of derivation or formulation
    May add some extensions
