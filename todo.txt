Application Process
ObsIn Lab has started 
    Labs done:
        Telescope Assemby 
        Optics
    To be done: 
        Basic Stargazing
        Astrophotography
Practicees:
    Isa palang. lmao.

Internship:
    Same mechanics as last time.

FAFO
    Fucked around with the big telescope. It was fun. 
        Would try to secure a formal permit.
    NISMED Maintenance and Cleanup session:
        On the works, cc Alvi.
    Would try to hold one sa tambs cleaning session ng obsin.
